# Avaritia
Are you the type of modded Minecraft player that makes a beeline for the designated "end game" and then gives up on ever playing again once you get there? Do you wish there was a way to make the process take significantly longer? Do you love GregTech, but wish it weren't so short? Do you sit down on your chest full of Galgadorian Drills and wish there was a mod that didn't just hand things to you on a silver platter?

This might be the mod for you!

The issue is practically guaranteed to be on your end. This is not tech support, please check the IRC. The link is below.
Update to Java 8. Uninstall Java 6/7.

Be sure you do not have duplicates of mods.
Make sure you've done the above.
Seriously, if you are crashing on startup, it is almost certainly something you have done incorrectly.
Try to make the crash happen with just Avaritia - nothing else.
If that last step worked, you may have a mod conflict. Update all of your mods.
If you still have an actual issue, report away!
